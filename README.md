# Blue Bite Assessment

## Assumptions

1. We assumed that the API response for the weather data contains a data object with properties such as location, condition, temperature and unit. This structure is essential for the proper rendering in the WeatherComponent.
2. The condition value returned from the weather API is expected to match the specific strings used in the WeatherIcon component (e.g., 'cloudy', 'rain', 'clear-day'). This requires consistency between the API response and the icon mapping.
3. I assumed that a basic error handling mechanism was necessary for the API call, but not overly complex, as we added a simple console error logging.
4. I assumed that the backend API at localhost:3030 is correctly configured to handle cross-origin requests if accessed from a different origin.
5. I assumed that the temperature unit (°C, °F, etc.) is consistently provided in the API response without the need for additional conversions.
6. It was assumed that the SVG icons used for weather conditions are imported correctly and that they match the expected conditions defined in the WeatherIcon component.
7. It was assumed that the API endpoint is reliable and will return valid data without downtime.
